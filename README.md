# Binary-Classification-Web-App

A basic web app which uses three different classifiers to determine whether mushrooms are poisionous or edible. The three classifiers are a Logistic Regression model, Support Vector Machine algorithm and a Random Forest algorithm. 

The user can choose which classifer to use and then view the confusion matrix, the ROC curve and the precision recall curve. They also can check the precision score and the recall score for each classifier.
